Welcome, you are on the personal web site of Bertrand Servin. I am a
member of the Animal Genetics Division of INRA. I work in the GenPhySE
lab, located in the INRA Toulouse Campus. My research focuses on
exploiting large scale genomic data to study the biology and evolution
of livestock species, through statistical modeling and data analysis.
